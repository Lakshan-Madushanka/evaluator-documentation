# 🌿 .env

### What is the `.env` file in Laravel?

The **`.env` file** in a Laravel project is a **special settings file** that controls how the website or app behaves.\
The name `.env` stands for **“environment”**, meaning it tells Laravel about the environment it’s running in  for example, whether it’s being tested, developed, or used live by visitors.

You can think of it as a **control panel** or **configuration sheet** that stores important information the website needs to run properly.

***

#### 🧾 What kind of information does it store?

The `.env` file usually contains key details such as:

* The **name of the app**
* Whether the site is in **development** or **production** mode
* **Database connection** information (how the website connects to its data)
* **Email settings** used for sending messages
* **Secret keys** or passwords for different services

Here’s what it might look like:

```
APP_NAME="My Website"
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://mywebsite.com

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mydatabase
DB_USERNAME=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

***

#### 🧭 What does it do?

When Laravel starts up, it **reads** the `.env` file to know how to set everything up.\
It uses these values to decide things like:

* Whether to show detailed error messages or hide them
* Which database to connect to
* What web address or domain the app should use

So the `.env` file acts like Laravel’s **instruction guide** each time it runs.

***

#### ✏️ How to view or change values

1. Find the `.env` file in the **main folder** of your Laravel project.\
   &#xNAN;_(It may be hidden — you can turn on “show hidden files” in your file explorer.)_
2. Open it using a text editor like Notepad or VS Code.
3. Look for the line you want to change, and edit the part after the `=` sign.
   *   Example: change

       ```
       APP_NAME="My Website"
       ```

       to

       ```
       APP_NAME="My New Website"
       ```
4. Save the file when done.

{% hint style="success" %}
If a value contains **spaces**, it must be placed inside **double quotes,** for example:

`APP_NAME=My Cool App`  ❌

`APP_NAME="My Cool App"` ✅
{% endhint %}

#### ⚠️ A few important notes

* The `.env` file often contains **private information**, like passwords or keys — **never share it** with anyone.
* If you’re unsure about a setting, **don’t delete or change it** without knowing what it does — the site might stop working.
* It’s a good idea to **make a copy or backup** of the file before editing it.

***

#### 💡 In summary:

The Laravel `.env` file is a **simple text file** that stores all the key settings for your website or app.\
Laravel reads it every time it runs, so it knows how to connect to databases, what name to display, and how to behave.

It’s powerful, but easy to understand, just remember:\
✅ Values go after the `=` sign\
✅ Use double quotes if there are spaces\
✅ Keep it private and safe
