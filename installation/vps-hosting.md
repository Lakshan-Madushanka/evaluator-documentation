# 🔑 VPS Hosting

VPS hosting provides greater control over your website and access to features that are often restricted in shared hosting. However, it requires some technical knowledge, and the experience can vary depending on the server configuration and technologies you choose.

For this reason, we’ve decided not to provide direct guidance on this matter. However, you can refer to the official Laravel [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/deployment) for detailed instructions. You may be able to complete the deployment on your own; if not, we’re happy to assist you; please feel free to contact us.
